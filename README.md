# Stores Microsoft Forms Response into Excel Sheet stored in One Drive
This solution of Microsoft Forms will save Microsoft Forms response to the Excel sheet with Microsoft Flow. Microsoft Flow Provides the integration between the Excel sheet and Microsoft Forms. So when anyone Responds to the Form itâ€™ll takes the Forms Response and put it into the Excel Sheet.

# Working Procedure

![Excel Sheet Table](https://github.com/mindlabco/Stores-Microsoft-Forms-Response-into-Excel-Sheet-stored-in-One-Drive/blob/master/Excel%20Table.png)

Note: For Perform any Operations into the Excel Sheet we must have to create the Table into the Excel Sheet.

Microsoft Forms
When Microsoft Forms gets Responded, Our Flow will get the Response.
